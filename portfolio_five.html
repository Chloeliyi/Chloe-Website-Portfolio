        <section class="portfolio_desc">
            <p>Mix & Match is a click game made solely by me using Unity Engine. The ganme starts with a set of random numbers with icons hiding them being
                generated, and the player has to click to turn over the icon and match the numbers in order to win the game. I also created my own icons using Adobe Illustrator.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also created a firebase to store the player data, as well as the leaderboard using firebase authentication and the realtime database.The player
                dataset consists of a randomly generated player id, name, password, email and playerStatus, while the leaderboard consists of the playerStatus, score and stage.
            </p>
            <h1> Game Play</h1>
            <p>Players will first log in or create their own accounts, afterwards they will be brought to the game start menu where they can view their 
                own profile, check the leaderboard or adjust the music. They may also log out if they wish. The game starts immediately after clicking the start button 
                and players have 1 minute to complete as many matches as possible. In each stage, there is a total of four matches to be made. Players can choose to 
                continue onto the next stage, restart the entire game or quit half-way. Afterwards, players can check the leaderboard to see if thereâ€™s been any updates.
