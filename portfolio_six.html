            <p>Room Perfection is a AR game made solely by me. It is a game made to showcase different furniture, where you click through to see the different kinds of 
                furniture and also get to design your own room with the furniture provided and take photos to share your creation.
            </p>

                Game Play
            </h1>
            <p>
                The player starts by hovering device over the ground image of an Ikea logo and watch as the start menu appears. From there, players can choose between 
                viewing the showrooms or going to decorating a room. Players can toggle between furniture and then take a photo of the completed room at the end. 
                After players have finished, they can choose to either quit the application or restart it.
